        <h4> CPU stands for Computer Processing Unit and CPU's are important because the CPU works as the brain for the computer. Pretty much the CPU fetches program instructions from RAM, interprets and processes it and then sends back the computed results so that the relevant components can carry out the instructions.</h4>

        <h4 class="right-h4">The RAM aka Random Access Memory is the place in a computer where the operating system, application programs, and data in current use are kept so that they can be quickly reached by the computer's processor. RAM could even make your games faster when your playing on your computer by adding more better RAM B-)</h4>

        <h4>The HDD or Hard Disk Drive is the device that is  used to permanently store and also retrieve information. Lots of the hardrives are internal drives which are are already installed in the motherboard when you buy it,
        but there are also external drives which are the same thing but portable!</h4>

        <h1>How do each different components communicate with one another?</h1>
        <h3>They communicate with something called a "computer bus" which allows 
            various motherboard components such as USB, serial, and parallel ports, cards inserted in PCI connectors, hard drives, and CD-ROM and CD-RW drives
            to communicate with one another and stuff like that.</h3>
